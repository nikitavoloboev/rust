## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.

## `flow` CLI

[flow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/flow) repo explains purpose of flow well. See [cli/flow](cli/flow) for its code.

To install `flow-rs` & put it in your PATH, run `task install-flow`.

All library code is in `lib/` (currently git ignored as there is only one library there in separate repo).
